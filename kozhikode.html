              <p class="card-text">Formerly known as Calicut, Kozhikode is located in Kerala. It was the Capital of Malabar during the Zamorin rule 500 years ago and is famous for its centuries-old trade in cotton and spices with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians and Chinese. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with the serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination.

                Vasco da Gama had set his foot on the remote beach of Kappad in Kozhikode in 1498 and 'Discovered India' and established spice trade routes with the west. Kozhikode city is the marketing centre for commodities like pepper coconut, coffee, rubber, lemongrass oil etc., produced in Kozhikode and the neighbouring districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur.  Being the major trade centre in Malabar and major exporter to foreign countries, the international travellers christened this district as ‘the noble emporium of India’.

              <p class="card-text">Kozhikode Beach is also known as the Calicut Beach and is situated on the Malabar Coast. The beach road was named as 'Gandhi Road' after Mahatma Gandhi paid a visit to Calicut in 1934. The place has always been prominent for hosting public meetings. It has a long drive from Beypore in the south to Kappad in the north. The beach is ideal for witnessing the orange sunsets in Calicut. Also, the market near is a large shopping spot and attracts a lot of tourists. 

                It is the most visited beach in Calicut as it is the central beach of the place. As a result of the 28 km long drive; Beypore, Payyanakkal, and Marad; Kallayi, Kuttichira and Thekkeppuram; Vellayil, South Beach and Valiyangadi; Kamburam, Putiyappa and Elathur, all beaches are a part of the Calicut Beach or the Kozhikode Beach. This entire stretch is known as the Beach Road. Located on the western side of Kozhikode town, the beach is easily accessible through 4 roads over bridges in the city. Kozhikode beach has ample illumination and paving stones.
                The other attractions here include a Lion's Park and an aquarium, which serve as excellent spots for children visiting the beach. It is open on all days of the week from 8:00 AM till 8:00 PM. The gorgeous beach is also home to two piers, situated towards the middle of the sea. Each of these piers dates back to a century ago. The evenings spent here are delightful as one can witness the giant tides engulfing the orange-hued sky during sunset. The tranquil atmosphere during sunrise and sunset attracts a lot of locals as well as travellers. In the early hours of the morning, people can even spot some real-life dolphin shows. It is a great spot for food lovers and photography enthusiasts. The rhythmic flow of the Arabian Sea is a delight to the eyes and soul.
